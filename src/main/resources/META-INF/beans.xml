<!-- Once upon a time you needed to declare all classes you wanted subject to CDI 
     in this file. The existence of this file turns on CDI. How it determines if 
     a bean will be subject to CDI is done based on the bean-discovery-mode that 
     can be annotated, all, or none. The choice of annotated is considered the 
     best practice. -->
